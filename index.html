						<li> You're very unselfish. Always thinking about others and have a huge heart. (and you're also soft cause of that)</li>
						<li> I know I always mention it, but that damn smile! You are gorgeous!</li>
						<li> I like it when you go all out on what you're doing. You say that you're not creative and all of that but you have some pretty great ideas. Like that whole song thing. How in the world did you come up with that. Even on the simple things like tellling me the play by play of a baseball game and taking it very seriously. You really do show affection even in the smallest things and I appreciate that.</li>

					<p>My dumbass is so unorganized that this was my reaction to every day that passed and your birthday got closer. Like what do I do!? It's gotta be perfect! Like I suck at picking presents and I rather do things in person. Then my timing sucks and stuff wouldn't have arrived in time for your birthday. I know you like birthday cards so I spiced it up a bit and did it my way! (Also cause it's something that you can see on your actual birthday and not at a later time when I see you).</p>
